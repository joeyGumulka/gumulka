        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Joey Gumulka, and I am currently a second-year student in the University of Windsorâ€™s Honours Computer Science Program. I am a native Ontario resident, having grown up in a small town north of Toronto. Since early childhood, I have always had a strong fascination with everything related to computers and video games.

        <h1>Early Passion for Computers</h1>
        <p>
            As I grew older, my parents fueled my passion by enrolling me in a weekend computer science program. There, I was first introduced to the basics of coding, sparking my love for the creativity it offers. Since then, I have been experimenting with developing my own programs and games. In high school, I took two computer courses, one in Python and the other in Java. Currently, I continue to explore my interests in computer science, enhanced by the knowledge I'm gaining at the University of Windsor.

        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
        <p>
            Though I have yet to work in the tech industry, I have valuable experience as a line cook in various restaurants. Working in kitchens has shaped my thought process and approach to communication. In the kitchen, communication is critical: orders must be completed and plated simultaneously, ingredients prepped, and space managed efficiently. I apply the same focus on clear, purposeful, and efficient communication to any team I work with, ensuring I am a productive and valued member.

I believe that a balanced life with diverse hobbies helps foster a dynamic mindset, allowing me to tackle new challenges while developing a wide range of skills.
