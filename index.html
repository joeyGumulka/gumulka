            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>&emsp;My name is Joey Gumulka and I am a current second year student in the University of Windsor’s Honours Computer Science Program. I am a native Ontario resident who grew up in a small town north of Toronto. Since early childhood, I have always had an intense fascination with everything computer and video game related.</p>

            <p>&emsp;As I grew older, my parents fueled my passion by signing me up for a weekend computer science program. There I was first exposed to the basics of coding and the joy and creativity it provides. From then onwards I have been experimenting with making my own programs and games. In high school I took two computer courses, one in Python and the other in Java. Now, I continue to grow and explore my interests in computer science aided by the knowledge I am gaining through the University of Windsor.</p>
        
            <p>&emsp;Another element of myself that is worth highlighting is that I am a French speaker. I began attending school in the French Immersion program at age 6 and continued until I graduated high school with an Ontario French Language Certification. Moreover, I have written and been certified at a DELF B2 level.</p>
        
            <p>&emsp;I would describe myself as a dedicated and ambitious worker. I always strive for the absolute best in anything I take on in life. Although I have yet to work in the tech industry, I have had a fair amount of work experience as a line cook in various restaurants. Being a cook is an experience that through the years has shaped me and my thought process. In the kitchen, there is nothing more critical than communication with your co-workers. Orders must be finished and plated at the same time, ingredients must be prepped, and space must be managed in a highly effective way for success. I firmly believe that this mindset of extremely purposeful, clear, and efficient communication is something I can apply working in any environment to ensure I am a valued and productive member of any team I find myself on.</p>    
            
            <p>&emsp;In my free time, I have many preferred hobbies. I enjoy playing the bass guitar, keeping a small aquarium, playing video games, and exercising. I strongly feel that a balanced life with a range of hobbies is critical in developing a dynamic mindset that allows you to tackle new challenges while giving you a diverse skill set.</p>
            
            <p>&emsp;In terms of the future of my professional career, as a young student, I am very open-minded and enthusiastic. I know that I most definitely would like to work with technologies; however, I could see myself finding a place in many sectors. As of right now, I have a particular interest in AI, software, and game design.</p>
            
            <p>&emsp;I am always open and available to be contacted and more than willing to discuss myself, my skills and experiences, or answer any questions. Please feel free to access my contacts as listed under the “Contact Me” tab.</p>
