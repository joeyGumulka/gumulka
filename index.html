                <p>&emsp;My name is Joey Gumulka and I am a current second year student in the University of Windsor’s Honours Computer Science Program. I am a native Ontario resident who grew up in a small town north of Toronto. Since early childhood, I have always had an intense fascination with everything computer and video game related.</p>
                <p>&emsp;As I grew older, my parents fueled my passion by signing me up for a weekend computer science program. There I was first exposed to the basics of coding and the joy and creativity it provides. From then onwards I have been experimenting with making my own programs and games. In high school I took two computer courses, one in Python and the other in Java. Now, I continue to grow and explore my interests in computer science aided by the knowledge I am gaining through the University of Windsor.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Another element of myself that is worth highlighting is that I am a French speaker. I began attending school in the French Immersion program at age 6 and continued until I graduated high school with an Ontario French Language Certification. Moreover, I have written and been certified at a DELF B2 level.</p>
                <p>&emsp;I would describe myself as a dedicated and ambitious worker. I always strive for the absolute best in anything I take on in life. Although I have yet to work in the tech industry, I have had a fair amount of work experience as a line cook in various restaurants. Being a cook is an experience that through the years has shaped me and my thought process. In the kitchen, there is nothing more critical than communication with your co-workers. Orders must be finished and plated at the same time, ingredients must be prepped, and space must be managed in a highly effective way for success. I firmly believe that this mindset of extremely purposeful, clear, and efficient communication is something I can apply working in any environment to ensure I am a valued and productive member of any team I find myself on.</p>    
                <p>&emsp;In my free time, I have many preferred hobbies. I enjoy playing the bass guitar, keeping a small aquarium, playing video games, and exercising. I strongly feel that a balanced life with a range of hobbies is critical in developing a dynamic mindset that allows you to tackle new challenges while giving you a diverse skill set.</p>
                <p>&emsp;In terms of the future of my professional career, as a young student, I am very open-minded and enthusiastic. I know that I most definitely would like to work with technologies; however, I could see myself finding a place in many sectors. As of right now, I have a particular interest in AI, software, and game design.</p>
                <p>&emsp;I am always open and available to be contacted and more than willing to discuss myself, my skills and experiences, or answer any questions. Please feel free to access my contacts as listed under the “Contact Me” tab.</p>

            <h2>Notable Achievements</h2>
            <p>- Dean's list in 1st year<br>- $1000 entrance scholarship for academic performance<br>- Cumilative avarage of 80.5% unweighted</p>
            
            <h3>Current Courses</h3>
            <h4>COMP 2660: Computer Architecture II - Microprogramming</h4>
            <p>
                In this course, we've been exploring the conversions between different base systems such as binary and hexadecimal. 
                We've also delved into the structure of a CPU and how data flows through the system using internal buses. Recently, 
                we’ve started working with assembly language, learning the basics of low-level coding and its interaction with the hardware.
            </p>
            
            <h4>COMP 2560: System Programming - The UNIX Reloaded</h4>
            <p>
                This has quickly become my favorite course this semester. We are studying system-level processes, including system 
                startup, the roles of operating systems, data partitioning, and the operation of shells. The deeper understanding 
                of how computers work and how the various processes I had previously never understood or thought about has proven to be very engaging.
            </p>
            
            <h4>COMP 2120: Object-Oriented Programming Using Java</h4>
            <p>
                This course introduces the core concepts of object-oriented programming through Java. We've covered basic topics like 
                classes, methods, inheritance, and instances. Additionally, this course has involved designing programs to apply our 
                in-course material to solve problems.
            </p>
            
            <h4>COMP 2540: Data Structures & Algorithms</h4>
            <p>
                In this course, we’re working with various abstract data types such as linked lists, doubly linked lists, stacks, 
                queues, and trees. We’re implementing these data structures in Java to solve practical problems, while also analyzing 
                the time complexity of different algorithms to categorize their efficiency.
            </p>
            
            <h4>PHIL 2220: Introduction to Social and Political Philosophy</h4>
            <p>
                We’re currently studying ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. The course focuses on their perspectives 
                regarding the foundations of society, political structures, and what constitutes an ideal form of government.

            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <h2>A Personal Website: An Exploration of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS</h2>
            <h4>The Beginnings - 09/26/24</h4>
            
            <p>This project segment is about the very website you are currently viewing. My objective in starting this project was to create a dedicated online space where I could showcase my projects and professional profile, allowing me to easily share my work.</p>
            
            <p>The process began with an extensive research session, during which I decided to use GitHub as the platform for building my website due to its reliability and ease of use in both writing and publishing content.</p>
            
            <p>The first step was constructing a simple HTML skeleton—a new language for me in the context of this project—forming the structural foundation for further development. I then incorporated styling by adding color, fonts, images, and layout using a combination of HTML and a separate CSS file. Since this was my first experience working with CSS, I devoted a considerable amount of time to learning the syntax and troubleshooting errors before achieving any meaningful results.</p>
            
            <p>The most challenging aspect of the project thus far has been implementing functional tabs that switch between different sections of the site. Initially, I used a pre-written JavaScript file to manage the tab-switching logic. However, the interaction between my formatting—particularly the use of Flexbox in the CSS—was causing the JavaScript to malfunction. To resolve this, I had to modify and rewrite portions of the JavaScript, as well as adjust my CSS to ensure compatibility.</p>
            
            <p>Looking ahead, I see this website as a platform for continuous improvement and development. I plan to integrate additional projects, such as interactive elements and games, as well as more refined and complex design features. This project has provided me with a solid introduction to web development, offering hands-on experience with a new platform and two new languages.</p>
